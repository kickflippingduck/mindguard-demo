# MindGuard React Native

This is a starter project implementing the basic navigation flow for the **MindGuard** mobile application. The app includes authentication screens and a tab layout for the main features.

## Available Scripts

- `npm install` – install dependencies
- `npm run start` – start Metro bundler
- `npm run ios` – run on iOS simulator
- `npm run android` – run on Android emulator

The project uses React Navigation and bare React Native components to keep the example simple.
